PROJECT 2 DEBRIEF -----------------------------------------
WHOO-EEE. 

Feedback from users: 
      - the layout of the smallest/phone size is not great, but I don't know what else
        to do (and they didn't have suggestions), so I've accepted it. 
      - Helpful insight about separating sections visually with shadows—incorporated on most
        of the breaks that were previously just borders (or plain white space)
      - Placement of the nav arrows. I knew this one would come up—I thought about embedding
        it in the chapter content (perhaps fixing it and the chapter heading), but I 
        was too intimidated early in the project + too locked in later. 
      - User didn't notice, but there's a little bug with the scrolling (page placement stays)
        after following a link sometimes. I could probably fix it with anchors, which is related
        to a user suggestion to make the Home view volumes collapsible.
    I'm pretty happy with how the navigation turned out, other than the placement of the back/next
    arrows. The placement and styling were clear enough to make it easy to get around without
    misclicking or wishing for a different kind of link to follow. (according to my husband at least)

Biggest takeaway: it's quite a challenge to structure/place things in a way that's resilient to change.
There were so many times that I wanted to adjust the spacing on one element and had to deal with that
cascading through to other elements. On the other hand, there were also a lot of times that I was able to 
avoid that thanks to flex/grid. I don't like how many hard-coded/slightly janky fixes the project has for 
div/content placement, both with styling and with stuff like embedding the hash for the back/next buttons. 

To explore more: 
    animation (I mimicked the style of the video to crossfade nav content; would like to learn
more about other/standard ways of animating content. Also, I didn't have time to get into it, but my animations
don't fire at the same time and I want to mess with async/await to get it feeling smoother for the user.)
    functionality/modularity. I broke everything out before starting Project2 proper, but I ended up adding 
a lot, and I'm overdue to sort through my features for better cohesion. In the same vein, I need to go through 
my styling again and make sure everything's applied at the most base level possible. 
    


POST-PROJECT 1 DEBRIEF ------------------------------------
This was my first time building a site with any complexity from the ground up (in JS, without any packages).
I've worked on a great hulking heap of React at MyEducator, but the context is 
so different that I really struggled with this at first. Following the videos was
easy, but it took me quite a while to find my bearings after the videos ran out and 
I had to figure out exactly what I'd done, so that I could tweak and add to it. I
definitely got a refresher on the basics of JS structure through this project. 

I'm proud of the functionality I built out - I'm fairly certain I covered all the
cases in chapter incrementing across books and volumes, for example. I'm happy with 
how comfortable I feel navigating this project now and how I could quickly identify 
what functionality is coming from where, make changes, and add new functionalities without
being absolutely lost and having to follow a single piece of data all the way through first. 
Also, it's a small thing, but I'm satisfied with my CSS placing the nav components. I'm 
used to (a) just copying the styling of whatever component I'm working on at work (b) using
bootstrap to do pretty much all the heavy lifting for me. It was a good refresher to revisit
flex and applying custom styles. 


PROJECT FOUNDATION PART 1 ------------------------------
The main things I learned from this assignment were about resources I wouldn't have had
access to otherwise—I've done a fair bit of web development in my other classes and
at work, so I was mostly familiar with the patterns.

The cache killer extension is a handy little tool, and I also didn't know about 
html5 boilerplate (I usually just make something barebones or copy it from a previous
project). I don't know that much about jquery, so it was good to do a little bit of
reading on my own about what it entails and why it's better to not include the package
when possible (beyond the obvious space/bloat saving).
