The main things I learned from this assignment were about resources I wouldn't have had
access to otherwiseâ€”I've done a fair bit of web development in my other classes and
at work, so I was mostly familiar with the patterns.

The cache killer extension is a handy little tool, and I also didn't know about 
html5 boilerplate (I usually just make something barebones or copy it from a previous
project). I don't know that much about jquery, so it was good to do a little bit of
reading on my own about what it entails and why it's better to not include the package
when possible (beyond the obvious space/bloat saving).
