PROJECT 2 DEBRIEF -----------------------------------------



POST-PROJECT 1 DEBRIEF ------------------------------------
This was my first time building a site with any complexity from the ground up (in JS, without any packages).
I've worked on a great hulking heap of React at MyEducator, but the context is 
so different that I really struggled with this at first. Following the videos was
easy, but it took me quite a while to find my bearings after the videos ran out and 
I had to figure out exactly what I'd done, so that I could tweak and add to it. I
definitely got a refresher on the basics of JS structure through this project. 

I'm proud of the functionality I built out - I'm fairly certain I covered all the
cases in chapter incrementing across books and volumes, for example. I'm happy with 
how comfortable I feel navigating this project now and how I could quickly identify 
what functionality is coming from where, make changes, and add new functionalities without
being absolutely lost and having to follow a single piece of data all the way through first. 
Also, it's a small thing, but I'm satisfied with my CSS placing the nav components. I'm 
used to (a) just copying the styling of whatever component I'm working on at work (b) using
bootstrap to do pretty much all the heavy lifting for me. It was a good refresher to revisit
flex and applying custom styles. 


PROJECT FOUNDATION PART 1 ------------------------------
The main things I learned from this assignment were about resources I wouldn't have had
access to otherwiseâ€”I've done a fair bit of web development in my other classes and
at work, so I was mostly familiar with the patterns.

The cache killer extension is a handy little tool, and I also didn't know about 
html5 boilerplate (I usually just make something barebones or copy it from a previous
project). I don't know that much about jquery, so it was good to do a little bit of
reading on my own about what it entails and why it's better to not include the package
when possible (beyond the obvious space/bloat saving).
